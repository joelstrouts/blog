title: Memory

I can picture the rows of hedges, rolling hills, and oak trees back home - but whether such things really exist, I have begun to doubt. Just like the existence of this place of thick crowds, thick air, and everywhere tall dirty buildings seemed so unlikely when it was a question of imagination a few months ago. They are so different, the presence of one erodes the plausibility of the other. What's most perverse is not that England now seems fictitious, but the absolute certainty with which the natural order of things will be restored - I will again know my oak trees, and my rolling hills, and so instead it will be the here and now that seems implausible. This table, the lingering smell of vinegar that started a few minutes ago, the fact that it is sweltering hot even in the dead of night. I will go home and these things will become foggy memories. Was it really that hot? How can a smell of vinegar just abruptly start? The more time passes the more unquestionable truth is replaced by just questions. And of course you can document thoroughly, take photos, record temperatures (the _feels like_ temperature here, right now, at 5AM, is supposedly 34Â° - I just checked) but that rather misses the point. It's not that I don't know what England is like, photos don't challenge the memory they just reassert it, but knowledge does not bring England here, and it cannot bring this moment back home.

It's always like that though. Even in just the one place. Every year in summer I think how strange it is that it was ever winter. Every time I'm ill, good health is mockingly incomprehensible. This failing of the imagination, a hard limit on the number of realities you can hold in mind (no more than one at a time) is mostly quaint. Don't you know that things go in cycles? So what if winter sounds like a sort of joke, (you're telling me this same sun, now oppressively hot, will become harsh and bitter cold, and these green trees will turn to looming wooden skeletons?) you will see it with your own eyes soon and summer will be the joke instead. A clockwork forgetfulness, even a little humorous. Humorous, that is, until you want to cling on to something, and something that won't just come back around like the hands on a clock.

Childhood is the first of these losses. You only have it once, you pay little attention, and then it's gone forever. Gone with mine is the memory of childhood holidays, which were often to the seaside, often to Guernsey. One detail that remains is of a game that I loved to play at the beach. My sister and I would work together, starting hours before the sea approached, digging trenches and erecting walls. Fortifying and establishing our own little enclave backed up against the sea wall - our goal to keep out the rising tide for long as possible. What begins as a very thoughtful architectural consideration quickly becomes frantic and hopeless - but great fun. My memory of this is entirely from a birds eye perspective, as if it is not my memory but my parents. Looking down from the promenade, cheering us on as we successfully diverted a minor flooding, or survived a breaking wave. It's funny remembering that game, because now it seems like the perfect metaphor for trying to hold onto moments. It's hopeless. Photos, essays, souvenirs - they are your fortifications and they do hold back the tide a little while longer, but with plodding wrath the sea foam approaches. Fighting the tide is symbolic, not effective. It's something you do for sport, for honour, not to win. The high water mark is feet above your head and no cleverness of sand architecture will stop it from being reached. Soon you have to leave your enclave lest you are washed away yourself, and look down from the promenade at the place you saved a minute longer, now no more than eddies.

So when you're fond of sand beneath you, and the tide bears down, what do you do? Do you have to fight? Half of me thinks fighting misses the point anyway. If you spend all your time worrying about the rising sea you can't enjoy playing on the beach. By always focusing on whether you'll remember something perhaps you prematurely switch your perspective from that of a child playing, to the parent up watching on the promenade. Living your life in birds eye rather than at ground level. Maybe you should wander the beach collect shells instead of building sandcastles, and there will be some serenity in accepting that your footprints will be washed away. There's something seductive about the idea. That the sea does not rage, but smooths. For every enclave eroded, a whole expanse of fresh sand is deposited. The tide is a gift, a blank canvas! But reality is not so serene I think. Beautiful memories are not lapped at but affronted. Perhaps the most offensive
