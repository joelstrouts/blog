I've finished the first stage of my research! I will write in detail about what I've learned in a future post but <i>for now</i> I would just like to share an interactive presentation I put together to explain the generative process for producing IFS images which is at the very heart of what I am doing.

## The Demonstration:

{% include components/IFS/exposition.html %}

Clicking on one of the buttons in the box above will initiate the presentation. Use the next/previous slide buttons to walk through at your own pace.

### Debrief

I intended for the presentation to be quite self contained but I will be writing a post soon which discusses the finer details of the process and the mathematics behind it.
